# SEM
Sem is Bachelor's thesis project of mine.It is a location based map game and has 2 different game types.

-Find to See
  
  With this game type, player's are expected to hide a prepared QR Code to spot in the city which is either important or to a spot 
  they want other players to see.After this other players will be able to see the game on map or list and start to play it.After they find the QR code
  they will be able to finish the game with embedded QR reader.Game creators also can put some photographs about the spot so other players can find it much more easily.
  
-Trekking on the Route

  With this game type we aimed to put "Free Tours" which we have around world to mobile interface.People can put several markers to places around city and they will be able to 
  follow the route over the map which already has the shortest walknig path drawn by Google map libraries.
  
  
#What do we need to work on this code

We need some libraries for this code to work.

-ZBarScannerLibrary
  We have to download Zbar scanner library from:
  "https://github.com/dm77/ZBarScanner"
  After this we have to import it to our project and it will automatically recognize it.

-Google Map Library

  From my repositories we will need this library for our routing calculations and drawing route process.It also helps you to do 
  almost everything possible that you can do over Google Maps.
